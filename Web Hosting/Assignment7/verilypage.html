            <p> Verily is Alphabet Inc.'s organization
          focused on health sciences. Recently, Verily
          has announced a new partnership with
          the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)
          company known as Dexcom.
          Verily's goal in working with Dexcom to
          create a more comfortable, less bulky,
          and more affordable CGM for diabetics.
          Typically a continuous glucose monitor (CGM)
          such as the Dexcom G6 which is the latest
          model released by Dexcom is used by
          diabetics to constantly track their glucose
          levels rather than having to prick their
          finger multiple times a day. Although this
          technology is an impressive innovation within
          the diabetes community, it's an expensive
          device that many diabetics can't afford which
          is why Verily's mission to lower the cost of
          the device is so important to many diabetics.
